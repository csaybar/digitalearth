  This report shows all the steps involved in pre-processing and analyzing two Sentinel-1 SAR GRD images via [**SNAP**](https://step.esa.int/main/toolboxes/snap/). The SAR images were taken before and after a forest fire in the summer of 2017 in Andalusia, Spain. Our results show that the burned area corresponds better with **VH** temporal ratio values than with **VV**.

# Part I - Classifiers



# Part II - Object features for classification

## Question 1
**What becomes obvious if you compare the values for the two objects of the chessboard segmentation?**


## Question 2
**Which features donâ€˜t make that much sense in this case?**

## Question 3
**How many objects were classified as "water"?**

## Question 4
**What is the area of the whole vegetation class (if you select the vegetation class to generate the feature, it will summarize the values from the grouped sub-classes)?**

## Question 5
**What is the meaning of the distance value when you create the feature?**
