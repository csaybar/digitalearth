# Part II - Object Statistic

**a) Describe shortly (3-5 sentences), why most of the classes of the second classification cannot be addressed in a pixel-based approach, give three specific examples.**

Because most of them depend on heuristic rules based on empirical knowledge. For instance, **Agricultural_grassland**, **river** and **lake** should have a specific shape, classes like **ship** and **island** request to be surrounded by other class, and others like **roads** and **park** matters the distance to a certain class. Pixel-based approaches use only spectral bands (threshold rules) that do not take into consideration spatial features.

**b)**

  - **Select the appropriate Scene Features in your final project and figure out the area (in map coordinates - not in pixels) for the class: Deciduous_forest**

  - **Select the appropriate Object Feature in your final project and figure out the Elliptic fit values (geometry feature) for the classes River and Lake.**

**c) Create a customized feature reflecting the following formula for a "greenness" index in your final project:**


  - **What threshold of the 𝐺𝑅𝐸𝐸𝑁𝐸𝑆𝑆 index could be used to differentiate between green vegetation (all the green areas in the image) and the other classes/objects?.**
  
  After try different greenness index threshold we found that the optimal range is  0.20 and 
  0.99.

  - **Can you explain why the "ship" object has an undefined GREENESS value?**
  
Because the ship object (black) has zero value in band 1 and band 2.
