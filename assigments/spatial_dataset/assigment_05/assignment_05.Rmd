## What is the universe of discourse in this example and how do you find it out?

In the example above, the universe of discourse would be all the entities related to urban/rural transportation: buses, employees, schedules, traffic, bus stops, etc. The first step to reference the universe of discourse is to create a global conceptual model, similar to the one created previously but with more entities and relationships.

## The description was provided to you by a non-database-expert. Are there some information you are still missing?

- More information on all the employees (not only inspectors and conductors).
- Importance of stops, weighted by user congestion.
- Average profitability of the lines.
- Annual maintenance cost of buses.
- Recurrence of transport use by users.
- Consider the traffic and time.
