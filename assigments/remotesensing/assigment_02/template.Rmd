# Question N° 01

**Import the aerial images and align them in order to create a sparse point cloud.**

Photos can be added via  **Workflow  > Add photos**. Once added all the photos, the next step is to align them (**Workflow > Align photos**, see figure N°01).

The **align photos** process given as an output a point cloud.

# Question N° 02

**Import the GCPs (.txt-file provided) and distribute them according to the GCP-overview. The detailed views of every GCP will help you to find the correct positions (Note: After the GCPs have been assigned to the respective marks, the sparse point cloud must be updated by clicking on "optimize camera"!).**

Once the images are aligned, it is necessary to import the GCP points by **import reference** and change the global parameters (See image below).

The GCPs are used to estimate and improve the accuracy of the images. The process consists of filter photos with a marker and right-clicking on each marker.

The error after placing all the GCPs is 0.03 m (see image below).

# Question N° 03

**Generate a dense point cloud from your correctly referenced data set**

A dense point cloud is a collection of point positioned which permits us to generate 3D visualization. To generate a dense point cloud in Agisoft you need to go to **Workflow > Build dense cloud**.

# Question N° 04

**Generate both DEM and Orthmosaic and to export them in GeoTIFF format. Visualize the dataset in a GIS environment and draw conclusions about their positional accuracy (e.g. by comparing it with a base map).**

Digital Elevation Model is a raster object which represents elevation data. To create a Digital Elevation Model go to **Workflow > Build DEM**.

<img src="img/img_10.PNG">

An Orthmosaic is a mosaic of orthophotos; go to **Workflow > Build Orthomosaic** to create one. 

<img src="img/img_12.PNG">

If we compare our results with the google satellite basemap we noticed that exists a significant geometric distortion between both images. Probably due to the lack of GCP used in the construction of the google basemap.
